A quick and easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner (large data mein se particular data ko read krne data visualization is used)
To read a data graphically or diagramatically using charts, graphs and maps

Libraries for Data Visualization:-
 1. Mathplotlib - low level, provides lots of freedom
 2. Pandas Visualization - easy to use, built on Mathplotlib
 3. Seaborn - high level interface, great default styles 
 4. ggplot - based on R's ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics
 5. Plotly - can create interactive plots

Mathplotlib : 2D and 3D plotting python library started in 2002 by john hunter

 1. Linear Plot
 2. Scatter Plot
 3. Bar and Whisker Plot
 4. Stem Plot
 5. Step Plot
 6. Hist Plot
 7. Box Plot
 8. Pie Plot
 9. Stack and Area Plot
 10.Fill_Between Plot
 11.Sub Plotl

 importing Mathplotlib:
  import mathplotlib.pyplot as plt
    or
